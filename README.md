# kaggle_titanic
Kaggle Challenge - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my submissions and Jupyter Notebook for the classic Kaggle Titanic competition. The goal of this competition is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Repository Structure
titanic.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook where I perform data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
submissions/: This directory contains my submission files for the competition.
datasets/: This directory contains the dataset files used in this analysis (optional if the dataset is too large or proprietary, in which case provide a link to where the dataset can be downloaded).

## Results
Submission 6 was the best prediction, scoring 0.73205.
